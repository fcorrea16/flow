# FLOW CHART BUILDER

## what is a Flow Chart?
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart)

> A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields

It let's you use a user-friendly design to help you build flow charts. There is a template with yes, no, first question, regular questions, and answers. You can pick whatever you want from the template and drag them around to edit position.
