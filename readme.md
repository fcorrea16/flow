## what is a Flow Chart?
see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flowchart)

> A flowchart is a type of diagram that represents an algorithm, workflow or process, showing the steps as boxes of various kinds, and their order by connecting them with arrows. This diagrammatic representation illustrates a solution model to a given problem. Flowcharts are used in analyzing, designing, documenting or managing a process or program in various fields
